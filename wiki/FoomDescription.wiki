=What is foom?=
foom is a toy language for my programming language/compiler design independent
study.  It will hopefully end up having the following features:
  * dynamic language
  * C-like syntax
  * optional typing
  * first-class functions
  * everything is an object
  * closures
  * continuations
  * mixins
  * list comprehensions
  * data types
    * [objectType object] obj
      * [integerType  integer] int
      * [decimalType decimal] dec
      * [stringType string] str (multibyte?)
      * [binaryType binary] bin (like a c-string, but safer)
        * [structType struct]
        * [unionType union]
      * [functionType func] {}
      * [listType list] []
      * [mapType map] [:]
      * [tupleType tup] <>  # mebbe... thinking about it
