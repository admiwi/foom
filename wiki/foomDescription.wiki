=What is foom?=
foom is a toy language for my programming language/compiler design independent
study.  It will hopefully end up having the following features:
  * dynamic language
  * C-like syntax
  * optional typing
  * first-class functions
  * everything is an object
  * closures
  * continuations
  * list comprehensions
  * data types
    * objectType
      * integerType  
      * decimalType 
      * stringType (multibyte?)
      * binaryType (like a c-string, but safer)
        * structType
        * unionType
      * functionType
      * listType
      * mapType

{{{
  obj o
  assert o.class == obj  #
  assert o is obj
  assert o.class.name == 'obj'

  int a = 12
  assert a is int
  assert a isa obj

  dec b = 12.0
  assert b is dec

  str c = "12"
  assert c is str

  str d = '12'
  
  list e = [12, 12]
  map f = [obj: 12]
