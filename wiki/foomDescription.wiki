=What is foom?=
foom is a toy language for my programming language/compiler design independent study.  It will hopefully end up having the following features:
  * dynamic language
  * C-like syntax
  * optional typing
  * first-class functions
  * closures
  * continuations
  * list comprehensions
  * data types
    * integer
    * decimal 
    * string (multibyte?)
    * bin (like a c-string)
    * function
    * list
    * map
    * object
